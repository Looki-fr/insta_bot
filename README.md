# insta_bot
run the .py file, not the .exe file (its a driver for chrome)

you need to have chrome browser installed on your computer

You'll have to enter your username (not email !!)

the unfollow method (choice '2') will not work if you have like 900+ followers

you also have to install python 3 and selenium (its a module for python)

you will have to modify in the code:
  - line 36: put the language of your instagram (it might be the 2 first letter, check the url of your instagram its at the end
      for example : https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/meme/?hl=fr, change 'fr' in '?hl=fr'
  - line 50: the 'self.tags_before' list, put the tags that you want to in the list (replace or remove or delete the tags that i put in), don't forgot the ',' after each tag !
  - line 68: same but with the 'self.banned_tag' list, for all the tag that you don't want to like pictures and follwo people (you can remove all the 'url' and leave an empty list), but WARNING here you'll need to put url and not just the tags
  - line 258: replace Confirmer (Confirm in english) by the text that have the confirm button in your language, don't forgot the caps

all the process will be a little bit long, otherwise you'll probably get 'banned' for 24 hours

if its don't work add me on discord I'll help you : Looki#0302

sorry for my english mistakes, have a nice day !
