# insta_bot
Instagram bot that is used to unfollow all the people that don't follow you
You have to enter your username (not email !!), password, the number of followers and the number of people that you follow in the shell via input

you need to have chrome browser installed on your computer

you also have to install selenium

the process will be long (20 secondes for each unfollow) but its to not be ban by instagram, if you want to change the time of wait its line 181

read the line 173 if you have a bug and modify the code like it say (for some people it work witout modifing but for others no idk why)

if its still don't work add me on discord I'll help you : Looki#0302
