# insta_bot
Instagram bot that is used to unfollow all the people that don't follow you
You have to enter your username (not email !!)

the unfollow method (choice '2') will not work if you have like 900+ followers

you need to have chrome browser installed on your computer

you also have to install selenium

all the process will be a little bit long, otherwise you'll probably get 'banned' for 24 hours

if its don't work add me on discord I'll help you : Looki#0302
